# Architecture Overview

This document explains the design and architecture of the SOC home lab environment.

---

## 1. Network Layout

The lab simulates a small enterprise environment with the following subnets:

- Internal Network: AD, Windows 10, Splunk
- Attack Network: Kali
- NAT Network: Internet access for updates and package downloads

All VMs share a VirtualBox NAT Network for internal communication.

## 2. Virtual Machines

### Windows Server 2022 (Active Directory)
- Hosts the `homelab.local` domain
- Provides Kerberos authentication
- Manages users, workstations, and GPOs
- Deploys Sysmon config to domain-joined machines

### Windows 10 Workstation
- Joined to the AD domain
- Generates user activity logs
- Runs Sysmon for detailed event monitoring
- Sends logs to Splunk

### Ubuntu Server (Splunk Enterprise)
- Receives logs from Splunk Universal Forwarders
- Parses Sysmon logs using TA-Microsoft-Sysmon
- Provides dashboards, alerts, and saved searches

### Kali Linux
- Used to simulate adversarial activity:
  - Lateral movement
  - Brute force attempts
  - Payload execution
- Helps test detections and alerts
